## Artifactory CLI

Artifactory CLI provides a command line interface for uploading and downloading artifacts to and from Artifactory.
It supports Artifactory version 3.5.3 and above.

### Getting Started

#### Downloading the executables from Bintray

If you do not wish to install/use go, you can [download executables](https://bintray.com/jfrog/artifactory-cli-go)
for Linux, Mac and Windows from JFrog Bintray. Select the architecture you want, download the art executable, and place it in your path.

#### Building the command line executable

If you prefer, you may instead build the client in go.

##### Setup GO on your machine

* Make sure you have a working Go environment. [See the install instructions](http://golang.org/doc/install).
* Navigate to the directory where you want to create the *artifactory-cli-go* project.
* Set the value of the GOPATH environment variable to the full path of this directory.

##### Download Artifactory CLI from GitHub

Run the following command to create the *artifactory-cli-go* project:
```console
$ go get github.com/jackspirou/artifactory-cli-go/...
```

Navigate to the following directory
```console
$ cd $GOPATH/bin
```

You'll find the art (or art.exe on Windows) executable there.

#### Usage

You can copy the *art* executable to any location on your file-system as long as you add it to your *PATH* environment variable,
so that you can access it from any path.

##### Command syntax

```console
$ art command-name options arguments
```

The sections below specify the available commands, their respective options and additional arguments that may be needed.
*art* should be followed by a command name (for example, upload), a list of options (for example, --url=http://...)
and the list of arguments for the command.

##### The *upload* command

###### Function
Used to upload artifacts to Artifactory.

###### Command options
```console
   --url           [Mandatory] Artifactory URL.
   --user          [Optional] Artifactory user.
   --password      [Optional] Artifactory password.
   --ssh-key-path  [Optional] Path to your private SSH key file.
   --props         [Optional] List of properties in the form of "key1=value1;key2=value2,..." to be attached to the uploaded artifacts.
   --deb           [Optional] Used for Debian packages in the form of distribution/component/architecture.
   --flat          [Default: true] If not set to true, and the upload path ends with a slash, artifacts are uploaded according to their file system hierarchy.
   --recursive     [Default: true] Set to false if you do not wish to collect artifacts in sub-folders to be uploaded to Artifactory.
   --regexp        [Default: false] Set to true to use a regular expression instead of wildcards expression to collect artifacts to upload.
   --threads       [Default: 3] Number of artifacts to upload in parallel.
   --dry-run       [Default: false] Set to true to disable communication with Artifactory.
```
###### Arguments
* The first argument is the local file-system path to the artifacts to be uploaded to Artifactory.
The path can include a single file or multiple artifacts, by using the * wildcard.
**Important:** If the path is provided as a regular expression (with the --regexp=true option) then
the first regular expression appearing as part of the argument must be enclosed in parenthesis.

* The second argument is the upload path in Artifactory.
The argument should have the following format: [repository name]/[repository path]
The path can include symbols in the form of {1}, {2}, ...
These symbols are replaced with the sections enclosed with parenthesis in the first argument.

###### Examples

This example uploads the *froggy.tgz* file to the root of the *my-local-repo* repository
```console
$ art upload "froggy.tgz" "my-local-repo/" --url=http://domain/artifactory --user=admin --password=password
```

This example collects all the zip artifacts located under the build directory (including sub-directories).
and uploads them to the *my-local-repo* repository, under the zipFiles folder, while keeping the artifacts original names.
```console
$ art upload build/*.zip libs-release-local/zipFiles/ --url=http://domain/artifactory --user=admin --password=password
```
And on Windows:
```console
$ art upload "build\\*.zip" "libs-release-local/zipFiles/" --url=http://domain/artifactory --user=admin --password=password
```

##### The *download* command

###### Function
Used to download artifacts from Artifactory.

###### Command options
```console
   --url           [Mandatory] Artifactory URL.
   --user          [Optional] Artifactory user.
   --password      [Optional] Artifactory password.
   --ssh-key-path  [Optional] Path to your private SSH key file.   
   --props         [Optional] List of properties in the form of "key1=value1;key2=value2,..." Only artifacts with these properties will be downloaded.
   --flat          [Default: false] Set to true if you do not wish to have the Artifactory repository path structure created locally for your downloaded artifacts.
   --recursive     [Default: true] Set to false if you do not wish to include the download of artifacts inside sub-directories in Artifactory.
   --min-split     [Default: 5120] Minimum file size in KB to split into ranges. Set to -1 for no splits.
   --split-count   [Default: 3] Number of parts to split a file when downloading. Set to 0 for no splits.
   --threads       [Default: 3] Number of artifacts to download in parallel.
```

###### Arguments
The command expects one argument - the path of artifacts to be downloaded from Artifactory.
The argument should have the following format: [repository name]/[repository path]
The path can include a single artifact or multiple artifacts, by using the * wildcard.
The artifacts are downloaded and saved to the current directory, while saving their folder structure.

###### Examples

This example downloads the *cool-froggy.zip* artifact located at the root of the *my-local-repo* repository to current directory.
```console
$ art download "my-local-repo/cool-froggy.zip" --url=http://domain/artifactory --user=admin --password=password
```

This example downloads all artifacts located in the *my-local-repo* repository under the *all-my-frogs* folder to the *all-my-frog* directory located unde the current directory.
```console
$ art download "my-local-repo/all-my-frogs/" --url=http://domain/artifactory --user=admin --password=password
```

##### The *config* command

###### Function
Used to configure the Artifactory URL, user and passwords, so that you don't have to send them as options
for the *upload* and *download* commands.
The configuration is saved at ~/.jfrog/art-cli.conf

###### Command options
```console
   --interactive   [Default: true] Set to false if you do not wish the config command to be interactive. If true, the --url option becomes optional.
   --enc-password  [Default: true] If set to false then the configured password will not be encrypted using Artifatory's encryption API.
   --url           [Optional] Artifactory URL.
   --user          [Optional] Artifactory user.
   --password      [Optional] Artifactory password.
   --ssh-key-path  [Optional] Path to your private SSH key file.   
```

###### Arguments
* If no arguments are sent, the command will configure the Artifactory URL, user and password sent through the command options
or through the command's interactive prompt.
* The *show* argument will make the command show the stored configuration.
* The *clear* argument will make the command clear the stored configuration.

###### Important Note

if your Artifactory server has [encrypted password set to required](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Configuring+Security#ConfiguringSecurity-PasswordEncryptionPolicy) you should use your API Key as your password.

###### Examples

Configure the Artifactory details through an interactive propmp.
```console
$ art config
```

Configure the Artifactory details through the command options.

```console
$ art config --url=http://domain/artifactory --user=admin --password=password
```

Show the configured Artifactory details.
```console
$ art config show
```

Clear the configured Artifactory details.
```console
$ art config clear
```

#### Security
Artifactory CLI lets you authenticate yourself to Artifactory either using your Artifactory user and password, or using RSA public and private keys.

##### Authentication with user and password
To use your Artifactory user and password, simply use the *--user* and *--password* command options as described above or configure your user and password using the *config* command.

##### Authentication using RSA public and private keys
Artifactory supports SSH authentication using RSA public and private keys. SSH authentication is supported from version 4.4 with version 1.3.0 and bove of the Artifactory CLI.
To authenticate yourself to Artifactory using RSA keys, execute the following instructions:
* Enable SSH authentication in Artifactory as described in the [Artifactory Documentation](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/SSH+Integration).
* Configure your Artifactory URL to have the following format: *ssh://[host]:[port]* using the *--url* command option or the config command.
Please make sure the *[host]* URL section does not include your Artifactory context URL, but only the host name or IP. 
* Configure the path to your private SSH key file using the *--ssh-key-path* command option or the *config* command.
